Engineering\_project
====================

Implementation and documentation of my bachelor of engineering project

 

Files:
------

-   **2015-01-skrypty** - scripts implementing the reference method

-   **Inzynierka** - folder containing the actual thesis

-   **PDFs** - folder containing materials for the thesis’ theoretical
    background and bibliography

-   **scripts** - temporary folder contatining modified reference scripts

 

How to make it work:
--------------------

The executable part of the thesis is stored in `Inzynierka/Matlab`

It contains scripts that are parts of the thesis implementation and the scripts
are implmenting following algorithms:

-   simple color segmentation by HSV channel tresholding

-   segmentation by k-means clustering
